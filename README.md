# Train-Scheduler

Train-Scheduler Database Site
What the project does?:

This project lets users add trains to my firebase database. Already added is 5 trains from the Philly area. 

Here's how the app works?:

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Why the project is useful?:

Teaches me jquery, javascript, css skills, firebase, moment.js, bootstrap.

How users can get started with the project?:

Type a train into the form and hit the submit button to see the train go live into the firebase and jquery update the dom with the info!

Who maintains and contributes to the project?:

Andrew Bagwell.
